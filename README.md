# React + Vite

This project is a simple TODO in React + Vite, using Context function to admin the state in applications, additional to using custom Hooks for it

Created by Bairon Bernal

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

•⁠ ⁠[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
•⁠ ⁠[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
